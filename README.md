Run `npm start` passing the challenge to run:

    npm start -- 02a.ts

It will also watch the script, re-running it upon changes.

It's also easy to run and debug scripts [via WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/running-and-debugging-typescript.html#ws_ts_run_debug_server_side_ts_node). `npm start` is preferable because it runs faster, but running via the IDE may be desired when debugging.
